# Portfolio Optimization using CVXPY

This Python project demonstrates **mean-variance portfolio optimization** using **CVXPY**, a convex optimization library. The goal is to find the optimal allocation of investments across assets to **minimize risk (portfolio variance)** while achieving a **minimum expected return**.

## Features

- Computes optimal investment weights for a portfolio of assets.
- Minimizes portfolio risk (variance) while ensuring a minimum expected return.
- Visualizes the optimal allocation using a bar chart.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries:
  - `cvxpy`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
